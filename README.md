## Project Description
A marketplace for RRC to buy, sell and trade items/opportunities (electronics, books, clothes, roommates, gaming buddies etc.) 

This app is going to ensure authenticity by ensuring login is done solely with valid RRC student credentials. 

- As a seller I want to be able to sell items that are not of use to me anymore that could be beneficial to someone else.
- As a user I want to know that the person I am interacting with is legitimate.
- As developers, we want to be able to bring comfort and ease to users by providicing an internal, dedicated platform.
